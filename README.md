# gnome-ram
A simple, light gnome utility that shows System's RAM usage as a percentage on the Gnome Panel. It shows **only** that, and nothing else!

Didn't want a full-blown extension, plus I wanted to learn how to create gnome extensions since I moved my work environment to PopOS!.

## To-do
- Add Icon
